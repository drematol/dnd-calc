# dnd-calc
A project for making dnd character sheets.

# dscription
This is a calculator made for getting derived statistics for a dnd character        
It uses openpyxl and .xlsx spreadsheets to create a light weight program that can generate a new spreadsheet      
The new spreadsheet can be taken outside of the folder and be further edited

# personal notes
this is my first project on git hub so please forgive any formatting mistakes
i wanted to practice automation in python and i ended up with this idea
more information about using the program can be found in the read me inside of the dnd calculator folder and      
thank you for checking out my program :) -drematol
