# dnd-calc
A project for making dnd character sheets.

This is a calculator made for getting derived statistics for a dnd character        
It uses openpyxl and .xlsx spreadsheets to create a light weight program that can generate a new spreadsheet      
The new spreadsheet can be taken outside of the folder and be further edited

here i've included the python file if you want to take a look at my code and the .exe inside of a folder if you want to use it on your own computer     
a bit of a warning though the exe folder is made for windows only     
this is my first project on git hub so please forgive any formatting mistakes     
i think i've learned alot about python but im not quite fluent yet      

more information about using the program can be found in the read me inside of the dnd calculator folder and      
thank you for checking out my program :) -drematol
