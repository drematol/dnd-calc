This is a calculator made for getting derived statistics for a dnd character
It uses openpyxl and .xlsx spreadsheets to create a light weight program that can generate a new spreadsheet
The new spreadsheet can be taken outside of the folder and be further edited

to generate a new character sheet edit values inside of character.xlsx (make sure to save) then run the exe
after that your new character sheet should be automatically created in the same folder based on the specifications in the character spreadsheet
feel free to remove your new spreadsheet from the folder and put anywhere else on your computer
please do not remove character.xlsx itself because it is needed for the program to run

multiclassing is supported
format your classes and levels like this:
x x x or x\x\x or x/x/x or x \ x \ x or x / x / x
any of these ways will work

an empty name value will make a "new character.xlsx" as opposed to a "<name>.xlsx"
an empty armor value will assume you are wearing no armor 
any armor value the program cant read defaults to no armor
therefor values like null or none or no armor also work

this calculator is accurate as of DND in 11/1/22 but is liable to change in the future
the code may be updated to support future armours classes features ect.

thank you for checking out my program :) -oliver falter
